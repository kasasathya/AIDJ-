# AI DJ Mixing System

## Overview

The **AI DJ Mixing System** is a professional, AI-powered DJ mixing pipeline that creates seamless, radio-quality mixes from your local music library. Using advanced audio analysis, machine learning, and OpenAI's GPT models, it automatically selects tracks, analyzes their musical characteristics, detects optimal transition points, and creates professional DJ transitions with perfect beat-grid alignment, gradual tempo sync, and intelligent energy flow management.

### What Makes This Special?

This isn't just audio stitching—it's **real professional DJ technique** automated with cutting-edge AI:

- 🎯 **Intelligent Transition Detection** - AI finds 3 optimal transition points per song (verse_end, chorus_end, breakdown_start, pre_drop)
- 🎛️ **Perfect Beat-Grid Alignment** - Sample-accurate beat synchronization with downbeat matching
- 🌊 **Gradual Tempo Sync** - Professional CDJ-style tempo ramping (32 micro-steps) instead of instant stretching
- 📊 **Energy Curve Analysis** - Detects buildups, drops, and energy transitions for context-aware mixing
- 🎵 **Harmonic Mixing** - Uses the Camelot Wheel to ensure key compatibility
- 🔬 **Multi-Factor Scoring** - Evaluates 6 factors (genre, vocals, energy, keys, BPM, type) to select best transitions
- 🎚️ **Progressive EQ Filtering** - Prevents frequency mud during overlaps
- 🎼 **Phrase-Based Transitions** - Snaps to 8-bar musical boundaries for natural timing
- 🎧 **Genre-Adaptive Mixing** - Different strategies for Afrobeats, R&B, EDM, Hip-Hop, Dancehall
- ⚡ **Dynamic Overlap Duration** - 4-16 second transitions based on musical context

### From Natural Language to Professional Mix

Describe what you want in plain English, and the system handles everything:

```
"start with love me jeje, then sensational, work me out, and finally outside"
```

The system will:

1. **Select** matching songs from your `./songs/` folder using OpenAI GPT-4o
2. **Analyze** each track with librosa (BPM, energy, key, phrase boundaries)
3. **Detect** 3 transition candidates per song using GPT-4o + energy curve analysis
4. **Score** each transition point using intelligent multi-factor algorithm
5. **Align** beats perfectly with beat-grid warping and downbeat synchronization
6. **Sync** tempos gradually (32 micro-steps) for inaudible transitions
7. **Mix** with professional EQ filtering and harmonic compatibility
8. **Export** a polished `output/mix.mp3` ready to play

## 🎮 Usage

### Quick Start (3 Steps)

#### 1. Add Your Music

Place your MP3 files in the `songs/` folder:

```
./songs/
├── Michael Jackson - Billie Jean.mp3
├── Tyla - Jump.mp3
├── Anirudh - Why This Kolaveri Di.mp3
└── ...
```

**Supported file naming:**

- `Artist - Title.mp3` ✅
- `01 - Title.mp3` ✅
- `[Source] Title.mp3` ✅
- Any MP3 format ✅

#### 2. Run the Pipeline

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

The system will prompt you:

```
Enter your DJ mix request: Create a 5-song mix with upbeat energy
```

#### 3. Get Your Mix!

```
✅ Mix complete! → output/mix.mp3
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Customize the Prompt in Code

Edit `run_pipeline.py` (line ~70):

```python
user_input = (
    "Create a 10-song progressive mix starting from slowest BPM. "
    "Include these must-have tracks: "
    "Michael Jackson - Billie Jean, "
    "Tyla - Jump. "
    "Focus on R&B and Afrobeats genres."
)
```

#### Command-Line Options

The pipeline accepts natural language, so you can request:

- **Genre-specific mixes**: `"Mix 8 EDM tracks with high energy"`
- **BPM progression**: `"10 songs sorted slowest to fastest"`
- **Must-include tracks**: `"Must include Artist - Song and Artist2 - Song2"`
- **Energy levels**: `"Create a chill low-energy mix for background music"`

---

## 🔄 How the Pipeline Works

### The 5-Stage Process

```mermaid

    A[User Prompt] --> B[Stage 1: Selection]
    B --> C[Stage 2: BPM Lookup]
    C --> D[Stage 3: Structure Detection]
    D --> E[Stage 4: Mixing Plan]
    E --> F[Stage 5: Final Mix]
    F --> G[mix.mp3]
```

### Stage-by-Stage Breakdown

#### **Stage 1: Song Selection** (`track_analysis_openai_approach.py`)

**What it does:**

- Scans your `./songs/` folder
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o to understand your natural language prompt
- Selects best-matching songs based on genre, energy, artist, title
- **Optional**: Applies energy curve ordering (warm up → peak → cool down)

**Output:** `output/analyzed_setlist.json`

**Example:**

```json
{
  "analyzed_setlist": [
    {
      "time": "00:00",
      "analyzed_tracks": [
        {
          "title": "Billie Jean",
          "artist": "Michael Jackson",
          "file": "Michael Jackson - Billie Jean.mp3"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

#### **Stage 2: BPM & Metadata Enrichment** (`bpm_lookup.py`)

**What it does:**

- Loads each MP3 file with librosa
- Detects BPM using beat tracking (NOT OpenAI - pure librosa!)
- Calculates energy level (RMS normalization: 0-1 scale)
- Uses OpenAI for genre and key detection (optional)
- **Caches results** in `notes/{song}_metadata.json` for instant re-runs

**Output:** `output/basic_setlist.json` + cached metadata

**Example metadata (`notes/` folder):**

```json
{
  "title": "Billie Jean",
  "artist": "Michael Jackson",
  "file": "Michael Jackson - Billie Jean.mp3",
  "bpm": 117,
  "genre": "Pop",
  "key": "F#m",
  "key_semitone": 18,
  "scale": "minor",
  "energy": 0.82
}
```

**Key Innovation:** Librosa-only BPM detection ensures accuracy without external API costs!

---

#### **Stage 3: Structure Detection** (`structure_detector.py`)

**What it does:**

- Uses OpenAI Whisper API for fast transcription
- Detects vocal presence in first 8 seconds (prevents vocal overlap)
- Finds optimal transition points using beat tracking
- Calculates **phrase boundaries** (every 8 bars = 32 beats)
- **Caches results** in `notes/{song}_structure.json`

**Output:** `output/structure_data.json` + cached structure

**Example structure:**

```json
{
  "has_vocals": true,
  "has_vocals_in_first_8s": false,
  "transition_point": 72.0,
  "intro_duration": 8.5
}
```

**Why this matters:**

- `has_vocals_in_first_8s`: If true, previous song must finish cleanly (no overlap)
- `transition_point`: Best time to start transitioning OUT
- `intro_duration`: Safe zone before vocals start

---

#### **Stage 4: Mixing Plan Generation** (`generate_mixing_plan.py`)

**What it does:**

- **Sorts songs by BPM** (lowest to highest) for smooth energy build
- Calculates **harmonic compatibility** using Camelot Wheel
- Determines **dynamic overlap duration** (4-16 seconds)
- Applies **genre-specific rules** (EDM = longer, Hip-Hop = shorter)
- **Snaps transitions to phrase boundaries** (8-bar alignment)

**Output:** `output/mixing_plan.json`

**Example plan:**

```json
{
  "mixing_plan": [
    {
      "from_track": "Billie Jean",
      "to_track": "Jump",
      "incoming_start_sec": 183.5,
      "start_time": "00:03:03",
      "transition_point": 192.0,
      "overlap_duration": 12.0,
      "transition_type": "Transition Overlap",
      "to_bpm": 120,
      "from_bpm": 117,
      "comment": "Billie Jean (BPM 117) -> Jump (BPM 120). Dynamic 12.0s overlap (no early vocals). ✓ Keys match (F#m→G). Transition at 192.0s, BPM change at 184.0s"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Professional Features:**

- ✅ **Harmonic mixing**: "Keys match (F#m→G)" or "⚠️ Key clash (C→F#)"
- ✅ **Dynamic overlap**: Adjusts based on BPM difference, key compatibility, genre
- ✅ **Vocal-aware**: Prevents overlapping vocals
- ✅ **Phrase alignment**: Transitions at natural musical breaks

---

#### **Stage 5: Final Mix Generation** (`mixing_engine.py`)

**What it does:**

- Loads MP3 files based on mixing plan
- Applies **professional DJ techniques**:
  - 🎚️ **Progressive EQ filtering** (low-pass on outgoing, high-pass on incoming)
  - 🎵 **Beat-matching** with minimal time-stretching (±2%)
  - 🎯 **Phrase-aligned transitions**
  - 🎧 **Genre-specific overlap** (EDM = 16s, Hip-Hop = 4s, etc.)
- Normalizes final output for consistent volume
- Exports polished `output/mix.mp3`

**Output:** `output/mix.mp3` (final professional mix!)

**Technical Details:**

- **EQ Filters**: 4th-order Butterworth (scipy.signal)
  - Low-pass: Starts at 12kHz → gradually cuts to 4kHz
  - High-pass: Starts at 100Hz → gradually cuts to 300Hz
- **Time-stretching**: Librosa phase vocoder (preserves pitch)
- **Normalization**: pydub normalize() ensures consistent loudness

---

## 🎵 Understanding the Cache System (`notes/` folder)

The system intelligently caches analysis results to avoid re-processing:

### Why Caching Matters

- **Speed**: Instant re-runs (no re-analysis needed)
- **Cost**: Saves OpenAI API calls
- **Consistency**: Same results every time

### Cache File Types

#### 1. Metadata Cache (`*_metadata.json`)

```json
{
  "bpm": 117, // Librosa beat tracking
  "genre": "Pop", // OpenAI classification
  "key": "F#m", // OpenAI key detection
  "energy": 0.82 // RMS energy (0-1 scale)
}
```

#### 2. Structure Cache (`*_structure.json`)

```json
{
  "has_vocals": true, // OpenAI Whisper detection
  "has_vocals_in_first_8s": false,
  "transition_point": 72.0, // Librosa beat analysis
  "intro_duration": 8.5
}
```

### Cache Invalidation

To force re-analysis:

```bash
# Delete specific song cache
rm notes/"Song Name"*.json

# Clear all cache
rm notes/*.json
```

## 🔬 Research & Development

### `research_stuff/` Directory

Contains experimental features and proof-of-concepts:

| File                               | Purpose                                  | Status      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `denis_chorus.py`                  | Chorus detection using NMF decomposition | 🔬 Research |
| `test_pychorus.py`                 | PyChorus library evaluation              | 🔬 Research |
| `test_madmom.py`                   | Madmom beat tracking comparison          | 🔬 Research |
| `openai/dj_transition_detector.py` | AI-based transition detection            | 🔬 Research |

**Why these aren't in production:**

- PyChorus/Madmom: Slower than librosa, similar accuracy
- NMF chorus detection: Unreliable on diverse genres
- AI transition detection: OpenAI Whisper API is faster/cheaper

### `older_way/` Directory

Previous pipeline version (pre-professional improvements):

**Key differences from current version:**

| Feature               | Old Way                       | New Way (Current)                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **BPM Detection**     | OpenAI GPT → librosa fallback | Librosa-only (faster, more accurate) |
| **Song Ordering**     | OpenAI decides order          | BPM-sorted (progressive energy)      |
| **Transitions**       | Fixed 8s overlap              | Dynamic 4-16s based on context       |
| **Key Compatibility** | Not considered                | Full Camelot Wheel implementation    |
| **EQ Filtering**      | None                          | Progressive Butterworth filters      |
| **Phrase Alignment**  | Random timing                 | 8-bar boundary snapping              |
| **API Provider**      | Google Gemini                 | OpenAI GPT-4o + Whisper              |

**Why we switched:**

- ✅ Librosa BPM is more reliable than AI guessing
- ✅ BPM sorting creates better energy flow
- ✅ Professional DJ techniques (EQ, harmonic mixing, phrases)
- ✅ OpenAI API is more stable/powerful than Gemini

---

## 🎯 Console Output Explained

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

**Test System:** Windows 11, Intel i7-12700K, 32GB RAM

| Mix Size | Analysis Time | Mixing Time | Total Time   |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 5 songs  | ~15 seconds   | ~15 seconds | ~30 seconds  |
| 10 songs | ~30 seconds   | ~45 seconds | ~1.5 minutes |
| 20 songs | ~1 minute     | ~2 minutes  | ~3 minutes   |
| 50 songs | ~3 minutes    | ~7 minutes  | ~10 minutes  |

**With cache (re-runs):**

- 5 songs: ~5 seconds ⚡
- 10 songs: ~10 seconds ⚡
- 20 songs: ~30 seconds ⚡

**Factors affecting speed:**

- CPU speed (librosa analysis is CPU-intensive)
- MP3 quality/bitrate (higher quality = slower)
- Cache availability (huge speedup on re-runs)
- Number of songs in library (scanning takes time)

```

**3. "No songs found"**

```bash
# Check songs directory
ls songs/

# Add MP3 files
cp /path/to/music/*.mp3 songs/
```

**4. "librosa fails to load audio"**

```python
# Check file format
from pydub import AudioSegment
audio = AudioSegment.from_mp3("songs/problematic.mp3")
audio.export("songs/fixed.mp3", format="mp3")
```

**5. "Mix sounds distorted"**

```bash
# Clear cache and re-analyze
rm notes/*.json
python run_pipeline.py
```

**6. "Out of memory error"**

```python
# Reduce number of songs in one mix
# Or increase system RAM
# Or process in batches
```

## 🆕 What's New in Version 3.0

### Intelligent Transition Point Detection

**Before (v2.0):**

```
All transitions at fixed 50 seconds
No context awareness
One-size-fits-all approach
```

**After (v3.0):**

```json
{
  "transition_candidates": [
    { "time": 67.5, "type": "breakdown_start", "score": 92 },
    { "time": 82.3, "type": "chorus_end", "score": 78 },
    { "time": 95.0, "type": "pre_drop", "score": 85 }
  ],
  "selected": 67.5,
  "reasoning": "Instrumental breakdown, no vocals, perfect for beat-sync"
}
```

### Perfect Beat-Grid Alignment

**Before (v2.0):**

```python
# Only aligned first beat
lag = first_beat_outgoing - first_beat_incoming
# Hoped beats stay aligned after tempo stretch
```

**After (v3.0):**

```python
# Aligns ALL beats with micro-corrections
1. Detect downbeats (beat 1 of each bar)
2. Align first downbeat (<10ms)
3. Check each subsequent beat
4. Apply micro time-stretch per segment
5. Result: <10ms drift throughout overlap
```

### Gradual Tempo Sync

**Before (v2.0):**

```python
# Instant tempo change (audible artifacts)
stretched = time_stretch(audio, 1.15)  # 15% faster instantly
```

**After (v3.0):**

```python
# Gradual ramp over 32 micro-steps
for i in range(32):
    progress = i / 31
    stretch = 1.0 + (1.15 - 1.0) * progress  # 1.00→1.15 gradually
    # Each step ~0.3% change (inaudible)
```

### Energy Curve Analysis

**New capability:**

```python
{
  "energy_analysis": {
    "has_buildup": true,
    "buildups": [
      {"time": 58, "peak_time": 64, "intensity": 0.045}
    ],
    "drops": [
      {"time": 120, "depth": 0.08}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Use case:** Transition at buildup → drop in next song = massive energy payoff

## 🎯 Advanced Usage Examples

### Example 1: Afrobeats Party Mix

```python
user_input = "Create a 6-song Afrobeats mix with smooth transitions"
```

**System will:**

1. Find Afrobeats tracks from library
2. Prefer `verse_end` transitions (genre rule)
3. Use longer overlaps (10-12s) for smooth blending
4. Avoid vocal overlaps (Afrobeats heavy on vocals)
5. Select breakdown sections for instrumental blends

### Example 2: EDM Energy Build

```python
user_input = "EDM mix with energy building to climax"
```

**System will:**

1. Sort EDM tracks by BPM (low → high)
2. Prefer `pre_drop` transitions
3. Time transitions at buildups
4. Use long overlaps (14-16s)
5. Align to phrase boundaries (8-bar)

### Example 3: R&B Smooth Flow

```python
user_input = "Chill R&B mix for late night"
```

**System will:**

1. Find low-energy R&B tracks
2. Prefer `breakdown_start` transitions
3. Avoid vocal clashes (R&B vocal-heavy)
4. Use moderate overlaps (8-10s)
5. Maintain smooth energy curve

### Version 1.0 (Legacy) - October 2025

- Google Gemini API for song selection
- Basic BPM analysis
- Simple crossfade transitions
- Fixed 8-second overlaps
- No harmonic compatibility
- No EQ filtering
